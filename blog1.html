        <p> The Ram Mandir is a Hindu temple under construction in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India. It is located at the
            site of Ram Janmabhoomi, the hypothesized birthplace of Rama, a principal deity of Hinduism.

            The site is the former location of the Babri Masjid which was built in 16th century CE. The idols of Rama
            and Sita were placed in the mosque in 1949, before it was attacked and demolished in 1992.In 2019, the
            Supreme Court of India delivered the verdict to give the disputed land to Hindus for construction of a
            temple, while Muslims would be given land elsewhere to construct a mosque.The court referenced a report from
            the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as evidence suggesting the presence of a structure beneath the
            demolished Babri Masjid, that was found to be non-Islamic .</p>

    <p align="justify">The bhumi pujan (transl.ground breaking ceremony) for the commencement of the construction of Ram
        Mandir was performed on 5 August 2020, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The temple, currently under construction,
        is being supervised by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. The prana pratishtha
        (transl. consecration) of the temple is scheduled for 22 January 2024.
        The temple has attracted a number of controversies due to alleged misuse of donation, sidelining of its major
        activists and politicisation of the temple by the Bharatiya Janata Party. </p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p align="justify"> The site is the former location of the Babri Masjid, which was built in the 16th century. The
        idols of Rama and Sita were placed in the mosque in 1949, before it was attacked and demolished in 1992. In
        2019, the Supreme Court of India delivered the verdict to give the disputed land to Hindus for the construction
        of a temple, while Muslims would be given land elsewhere to construct a mosque.The court referenced a report
        from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as evidence suggesting the presence of a structure beneath the
        demolished Babri Masjid, that was found to be non-Islamic. However, the ASI claims were heavily disputed by
        critics as contradictory and unreliable. But, these became futile as the Supreme Court, after detailed
        proceedings, accepted the ASI report as valid. The Supreme Court in its landmark jugdement concluded that the
        underlying structure beneath the mosque was not an Islamic structure, and also that there is clear evidence that
        the disputed site was believed by Hindus as the Janmabhoomi (birthsite) of Rama. It is believed the temple was
        attacked and destroyed by the first Mughal emperor, Babur, in 1528, in his series of temple raids across
        northern India. Later, in the same year, under the order of Babur, the commander of the Mughal Empire, Mir Baqi,
        constructed a mosque, the Babri Masjid, in the site of the Ram Janmabhoomi, the birthplace of Rama.The earliest
        record of the mosque may be traced back to 1767, in the Latin book Descriptio Indiae, authored by the Jesuit
        missionary Joseph Tiefenthaler. According to him, the mosque was constructed by destroying the Ramkot temple,
        believed to be the fortress of Rama in Ayodhya, and the Bedi, where the birthplace of Rama is situated.</p>

    <h3> Modern</h3>
    <p align="justify">In the 1980s, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), belonging to the Hindu nationalist family, Sangh
        Parivar, launched a new movement to reclaim the site for Hindus and to erect a temple dedicated to the infant
        Rama (Ram Lalla) at this spot. The VHP began to collect funds and bricks with "Jai Shri Ram" written on them.
        Later, the government under Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi gave the VHP permission for Shilanyas (transl.the
        foundation stone ceremony) to proceed, with the then Home Minister, Buta Singh, formally conveying the
        permission to the VHP leader, Ashok Singhal. Initially, the Government of India and Government of Uttar Pradesh
        had agreed that the shilanyas would be conducted outside of the disputed site. However, on 9 November 1989, a
        group of VHP leaders and Sadhus laid the foundation stone by digging a 200-litre (7-cubic-foot) pit adjacent to
        the disputed land. The singhdwar (transl.main entrance) of the sanctum sanctorum was constructed there.The VHP
        then laid the foundations of a temple on the land adjacent to the disputed mosque. On 6 December 1992, the VHP
        and the Bharatiya Janata Party organised a rally at the site involving 150,000 volunteers, known as karsevaks.
        The rally turned violent, the crowd overwhelmed the security forces and tore down the mosque.

        The demolition of the mosque resulted in several months of inter-communal violence between India's Hindu and
        Muslim communities, causing the death of an estimated 2,000 people in Bombay (now Mumbai) as a direct
        consequence, and triggering riots all over the Indian subcontinent.A day after the demolition of the mosque, on
        7 December 1992, The New York Times reported that over 30 Hindu temples across Pakistan were attacked, some set
        on fire, and one was demolished. Hindu temples in Bangladesh were also attacked.

        On 5 July 2005, five terrorists attacked the makeshift Ram temple at the site of the destroyed Babri Masjid in
        Ayodhya. All five were shot dead in the ensuing encounter with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), while
        one civilian died in the grenade attack that the attackers launched to breach the cordoned wall. The CRPF
        suffered three casualties, two of whom were seriously injured with multiple gunshot wounds.</p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p align="justify"> Final judgment delivered. The Supreme Court ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to
        build the Ram temple. It also ordered the government to give 2.0 hectares (5 acres) of land inside Ayodhya city
        limits to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board for the purpose of building a mosque.In November 2019, the
        Supreme Court of India ruled that the disputed land in Ayodhya should be given to a trust to build a Ram temple.
        The court also ordered the government to give the Sunni Waqf Board five acres of land in another location to
        build a mosque. Construction of the temple began in 2020.The court divided the disputed structure into two
        parts: the inner and the outer courtyard. The court concluded the arguments in favor of the Hindu side.
        The temple's inner sanctum features a 1.3-meter (4.25-foot) dark stone sculpture of Ram. The religious ritual of
        “Pran Pratishtha” was conducted to give life to the idol.

    <h5>Slogan</h5>
    <p align="justify"> Mandir wahi banayenge (transl.The temple will be built exactly there) is an expression in Hindi,
        and has become one of the most popular slogans concerning the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and Ram Mandir. It has
        been used as early as 1985-86, was popularised in the 1990s, and has several variations.It has been a symbol of
        hope and it has become a part of festivities, and has also become a part of stand-up comedy, jokes and memes.In
        2019, the slogan was used in the Parliament of India,and it has also been used by media houses.The slogan has
        been used as a threat as well as a vow. There are variations of the slogan such as one used by Lal Krishna
        Advani: "Saugandh Ram ki Khat-e hain; Hum Mandir Wahin Banayegein" (transl.We take a vow of Rama that we will
        build the temple exactly there).Other variations and adaptations include "Wahin Banega Mandir" (transl.A temple
